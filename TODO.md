# TODO

- implement UTF16 parsing for old (pre 1.6.4) protocols
- test protocol 78 (1.6.4)
- integrate zlib for compression
- figure out what protocol actions we need to break blocks and open guis
- probably abstract everything further, maybe generate code?
- setup proper chunk handling (fun fact if you don't tell the client to drop chunks it wont)
- make custom worldgen and world storage (oct trees might be fun)
